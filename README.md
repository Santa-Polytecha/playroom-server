## Playroom Server
Building Multiplayer Games with Node.js and Socket.IO.
Implementing Socket.IO in an OOP environment with ES6 classes.

### Introduction
This project aims to experiment with Node.js and the Socket.IO library in order to create a real-time gaming experience.

### Launch project
Your computer must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

In order for the project to work run the following commands :
    
    > npm install
    > node server
  
You can add your own .env file with your own port configuration.
    
    > ENV_PORT = 3002
    

### Technologies

- **Node.js** - Node provides the foundation for the back-end portion of the game, and allows the use of the Socket.IO library.

- **Socket.IO** - Socket.IO makes it possible and simple to open a real-time, bidirectional communication channel between a web browser (if it supports websockets protocol) and a server.

This is a socket-io and node-js object oriented code structure approach in order to encapsulate room and games logic.

### Features description

We have three logical layers to the user experience. 
First, we have what we call the Lobby where every users connect by default.
Then we have a room. It holds logic for users in the same room given a socket room name.
And finally we have a game. An instance of a specific game for a specific room.

| Create a new room | A player can also a new room instance. The server will return an ID, so that others can use it to join. |
| Join a room       | A player will be able to join a room by specifying the roomâ€™s ID.                                       |
| Start a game      | The game owner can start a choosen game.                                                                |

### Games 

Start a new game means creating a new instance of a particular game :
    - Chat game
    - Drawing game
    ...
This new instance will be specific to a room.
Any modifications done to this game will only affect the room so that many groups can play the same game.
